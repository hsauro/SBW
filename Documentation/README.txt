1. Introduction
---------------

This is the top of the documentation tree for the Systems Biology Workbench
(SBW) software system.  Depending on the distribution of SBW that you have
(e.g., the full version versus the binary-only installation), some of the
following subdirectories may be missing.

  Subdirectory     Contents                                      Format(s)
  -------------    --------------------------------------------- ----------
  autogenerated    Documentation generated by Javadoc & Doxygen  HTML
  programmer       API manuals for programming with SBW          PDF
  user             User-level documentation                      PDF

The contents of the subdirectories are hopefully self-evident.  For
example, the Java API manual is in a file called "api/Java_API.pdf", the C
manual is in "C_API.pdf", etc.

----------------------
2. Other documentation
----------------------

The SBW distributions only include PDF documents (and in some cases, HTML)
in order to reduce disk space requirements.  However, these documents are
available in other formats.  Please visit the project web site at
http://www.sbw-sbml.org for more information.

Please also go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/ and visit the
mailing list area for the Systems Biology Workbench project.  There you can
add yourself to different mailing lists related to the project.

Your feedback will help us to make a better and more portable package.
Consider documentation errors as bugs, and report them as such.  If you
develop anything pertaining to SBW or have suggestions, let us know and
share your findings by using the bug tracking facilities for the project at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbw/.
